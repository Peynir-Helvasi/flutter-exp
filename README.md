# demo

A new Flutter project to learn how to code and the structure of the flutter and mobile programming. It has been like a playground for me. My first goal for now is learnin how to coding mobile prog and pracitising on dart.
Hopefully, next step is going to be the code something impactable to the project that satisfys me. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application to learn mobile programming.

It's  an app used for movies that you have watched or going to watch.
At the final of the project, user can make lists, command, share, and make voice chats (I don't know if i can do it but i am gonna try.) on app about movies.

## Current Point
For now, the codes of the project is simlpy noodle and not organised. It's for trying everything on the code.
I'm gonna change everything in every step and make it more proffessional.
